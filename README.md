# Hack4Impact Spring 2026 Technical Assessment
Welcome to the Hack4Impact Spring 2026 application assessment!

## Your Task

Your goal is to complete the functionality of this application. You have been provided with a set up codebase.
Follow the instructions below to get started on the assessment. The document with more detailed instructions for the assessment is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9pqIB9a0xGttdrsEzJMIP-gnirHiUXMKtzPF2bZ_aY/edit?usp=sharing).


## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up your Environment:**
    You will need an API key from the [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/using-the-api/api-key). Follow the instructions on the linked page. Once you have your key, add it to the `openaq.ts` file located in the project:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file and add it there.

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. If not this location, it will show where to open up your application in terminal.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your work.
