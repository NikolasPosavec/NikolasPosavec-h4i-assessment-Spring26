# Hack4Impact Spring 2026 Technical Assessment
Welcome to the Hack4Impact Spring 2026 application assessment!

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up your Environment:**
    You will need an API key from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Once you have your key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key to it:
    ```
    VITE_OMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. If not this location, it will show where to open up your application in terminal.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your work.
